# Programing language & version:-
python 3.11.7

# Libraries:-
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

# Input/assignment files:-
matrix1.txt:- contains data matrix of cancer expression of different types

matrix2.txt:-  contains data matrix of cancer expression of different types

# Description:-
Analyzed the correlation within each dataset (matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt) and generated heatmaps for visualization. Computed Pearson correlation coefficients and compared correlations across different cancer types between two high-throughput cancer data matrices.

# Output files:-
correlation_matrix1:- contains correlation values for matrix 1

correlation_matrix2:- contains correaltion values for matrix 2

correlations_data.csv:- Contains Correlation values for each cancer type across the two datasets and the overall correlation value.

Visualizations (displays when the code is executed) :

Heatmap of Pearson Correlation for Matrix 1

Heatmap of Pearson Correlation for Matrix 2
